Build relations:
================

Each language is a build to .com file where the language specific
message.msg and font.fnt files must be included.  The source for
each build is gag.asm.  TASM accepts an option to define an include
path.  The file mklang.bat uses the folder name for the language as
an arg to pass this option; i.e. "mklang english" will set ".\english"
as an include path.  The folder named must hold its language specific
files, message.msg and font.fnt.  This language name is then the name
of the .com from TLINK.

The overall source image uses install.asm and boot.asm as startup and
install sources.  'boot.asm' is the floppy MBR bootloader source.
install.asm is the installer program.  Its use is to put up install
screens for the user to select his hardware and language.  From those
selections the corresponding language.com file is installed to the first
cylinder (64 sectors = 32 kB max).  The file mkmain.bat invokes TASM and
TLINK for install.asm and boot.asm.  It also invokes TASM and TLINK for
hdboot.asm used for Linux direct installs.

mezcla.c builds a 1.44 M floppy image of all these .com sources saving
the result as disk.dsk, a floppy image file.   mmezcla.bat invokes
BCC32 and ILINK32 to create mezcla.exe, a DOS command line executable.

install.asm includes the file message.txt as its source of all on screen
text messages.  mezcla.c copies all the language.com files to the floppy
image.  !!! It is critical that the copy order in mezcla.c match exactly
the numbered naming order of the languages in messages.txt !!!
The installer uses the index of this naming order to locate the start of
chosen language.com file.
