1. Do I have to pay money for GAG?

No, you do not. GAG is free software, distributed under a GPL license. 
Of course, if you want to pay money you can do it, just write me 
(look at my e-mail address at the end of the text). 
For more details about the GPL license, read it in the main menu.


2. Where's the mouse cursor?

GAG can't (yet) use the mouse. You must use the keyboard.


3. What is the Boot Floppy option intended for? Can I delete it?

You can delete it and add it again later if you want or need it. 
That option allows you to boot a disk from GAG, so you can disable 
the option of booting from floppy in the BIOS SETUP. 
If you need to boot from a floppy, you can use GAG instead of 
enabling it again. This is good because if you restart your computer, 
you don't need to drop out the floppy from the drive. 
I hope to add support for booting from CD-ROM too.


4. How can I uninstall GAG?

Just boot with the installation floppy (or CD) and choose the option 5.


5. I want a version of GAG in my language. What do I have to do?

Just write me, and I'll send you the files you have to translate and how.


6. I can't boot Linux from GAG. What can I do?

Be sure you have installed LILO or GRUB in the SuperBlock of your Linux
partition. That is, if your root partition is /dev/hda8, be sure you
install LILO or GRUB in /dev/hda8, not in /dev/hda.


7. I have an AZERTY (or QWERTZ) keyboard, and I can't do some actions.

That's because the PC computer's BIOS were developed to use QWERTY
keyboards. In France it is common to use AZERTY keyboards, they have a
different layout of the keys. 
The same occurs in Germany, where they use QWERTZ keyboards.

To fix your problem, just select AZERTY or QWERTZ keyboard 
when the installation program asks you.

To know what kind of keyboard you have, just see the first six letters
in the upper left row.


8. I have two (or more) MS-DOS/WINDOWS primary partitions. I was able
to access to them, but now with GAG I can only read the boot partition.
Is it a bug?

No, it isn't a bug. To allow users to have more than one version of
DOS, or to have DOS and Windows, or DOS and OS/2, or Windows and OS/2,
GAG can hide all the primary partitions located BEFORE the boot
partition (this is a new behaviour; in old versions, all partitions
were hidden). This is done to avoid interferences during the boot proccess.

Starting from GAG 4.11 you can choose the behavior of this option. 
If you want to be able to see your primary partitions, just be sure that 
the option "HIDE PRIMARY PARTITIONS" is DISABLED (this is, it has no
number).


9. When I install GAG 4.0 in my hard disk, I receive a 'Disk error'
message, but GAG 2.1 works fine. What's the problem?

GAG stores itself in the first track of the hard disk. This track is
reserved for this kind of program. Versions 2.1 and earlier were much
smaller and could be installed in only 17 sectors.  This new version 4.11
needs 42 sectors, and versions 4.5 and later uses 62 sectors.

If your hard disk is old (made before 1992) and/or you don't have the LBA
mode active in the BIOS, it is possible that it does not have enough sectors
in the first track to store GAG 4.11, so you must use GAG 2.1. But don't worry,
with newer hard disks (made after the year 1992) this will not happen because
all have 63 sectors per track.


10. I can't boot OS/2 with GAG. What do I have to do?

GAG can boot OS/2 only if it is installed in a primary partition. 
If your OS/2 is installed in an extended partition and you want 
to have the benefits of GAG, you must still use the IBM Boot Manager. 
To do this, just put the IBM BM timer to zero seconds, and configure 
the icon of OS/2 to boot the partition where the Boot Manager is stored.

Another problem is when OS/2 is installed in a primary partition in
a hard disk that is not the first hard disk. In this case, you must
say YES to the option 'Exchange drive letters' when you add the OS/2
partition to GAG. In this case you don't need to use the IBM Boot Manager.


11. When I choose the 'Add operating system' option, GAG doesn't show all
my partitions. What happens?

There are two possibilities:

 a) It is possible that you have one or more partitions that starts beyond 
the 8 Gigabytes limit, and your BIOS is old and does not support the
extensions that allows booting from them. In that case, GAG has to use the old
access method, which cannot access data located beyond that limit. This
happens in motherboards with BIOSes created before 1998, and in old SCSI
adapters.

 b) You are attempting to add a partition that is in the second, third...
hard disk.  GAG shows only the partitions for ONE hard disk each time, so
to list the partitions in the second hard disk, you must press the '2' key.
Then, GAG will show you the content for the second hard disk. If you press
the '3' key, GAG will show you the content for the third hard disk, and so
on. (easy, isn't it? :-)


12. Must the floppy disk image file must have a length of 1.44 megs, 
or can I cut it?

Not really. Current GAG disk image needs about 700 Kbytes. But in the near
future, new language versions could be added, so I strongly recommend to
use the whole 1.44 megs file, instead of cutting it.


13. I don't want LILO/GRUB to ask me for an operating system, after being
booted from GAG. Is there any solution?

Yes, there is. Log into your Linux box as root, and edit the file
/etc/lilo.conf. There you must delete the lines:

        delay=nnn
        prompt

(where nnn is a number). After saving the file, just run 'lilo' 
(without quotes) from a shell or command line window.

For GRUB, just edit the file /boot/grub/menu.lst. There you must modify the
line:

timeout = X

(where X is a number). Just change X to 1 (1 second) and save it. Now just
run 'grub-install /dev/XXX', being /dev/XXX the root partition (ex: if your
root partition is /dev/sda8, just run 'grub-install /dev/sda8').


14. How can I select what Linux kernel I want to boot from GAG?

GAG can't select a kernel to load (this is why you must still use LILO or
GRUB), but there's a trick to do it.

You will need as many EXT2 partitions as kernels you want to boot. But don't
worry: you can count your 'root' (/) partition, your '/home' partition, your
'/usr' partition, etc. into this, so if you want to boot two kernels and you
have your system divided into two or more partitions, you don't need to create
more.

You have to install a different LILO in each partition, with one
kernel selected in each one. To do this with LILO, you must select a different
map file in each lilo.conf file that you create, because that file contains
the data for LILO's second stage for each boot.

Save each lilo.conf with the configuration of each kernel to boot with a
different name in /etc. As an example, you can name them as 'lilo.conf.1',
'lilo.conf.2', and so on.

install each lilo.conf.n file with:

        lilo -C lilo.conf.n

This will install lilo using the file 'lilo.conf.n' instead of the default
'lilo.conf'. Since each 'lilo.conf.n' file has a different partition target,
kernel and map file, you will install a different LILO in each partition.

Finally, go to GAG and add each partition with LILO to it (of course, with
different names, or you will not be able to distingish between them :-)

Remember: use a different map file (map=/etc/map.n) in each lilo.conf.n file. 
If you don't do this, only one partition will boot successfully, and the others 
will hang with a 'LIL-' text on the screen when you try to boot them.

And don't worry: the map file is created by LILO each time you run it. 
You don't need to create one before.


15. GAG shows some partitions in black, and others in blue. What does it mean?

Don't worry, it's not a bug. Black partitions are the primary partitions, 
and blue partitions are the extended partitions. 
I added this to help people to configure GAG more easily.


16. I want to boot a Linux partition that is beyond the 8 Gigabytes limit, 
but LILO stops loading, showing an 'L' (or 'LI') line in the screen.

That's because you need a recent version of LILO (21.3 or greater) in order
to be able to boot. You must also put the string 'lba32' in your lilo.conf
file and re-run 'lilo', to tell it that it must use the new BIOS extensions
to boot Linux. If you don't do this, LILO will use the old BIOS calls and it
will not be able to boot a partition located beyond the 8 Gigabyte limit.


17. Can I boot a Windows installed in the second, third... hard disk?

Yes, you can. You only have to answer 'yes' to the option 'Exchange drive
letters?'. But warning, read the question 18 too.


18. When I boot a Windows 95/98/ME installed in the second, third... hard
disk, I can't see the CD-ROM icon. How can I fix it?

When you boot an operating system with the 'Exchange drive letters' option
active, GAG installs a little resident program in the memory that intercepts
all the read and write calls for the hard disks, and changes the parameters
in a way that the calls for the first hard disk will be redirected to the 
other drive, and viceversa. 
When Windows 95/98/ME detects this, it doesn't use its 32bit drivers for 
disk access. It uses the MS-DOS that is under it (yes, even under Windows ME 
is an MS-DOS). Since MS-DOS does not have the ability to access a CD-ROM, 
ZIP drives, etc. without a driver, Windows also cannot access them.

To fix it, you only need to reboot in MS-DOS mode (see below how to do this
in Windows ME) and install the MS-DOS drivers that comes with your nonworking
drive. As an example, in the case of a CD-ROM, you have to install in the
CONFIG.SYS a file called in a similar way to CDATAPI.SYS, which is in the
floppy that comes with the CD-ROM drive, and in the AUTOEXEC.BAT you have
to install the MSCDEX.EXE file, which is in the WINDOWS directory.
Of course, you must add the right parameters in order to make it work.
But don't worry if this sounds complicated, because it is very common that 
the floppy has a little BAT file that install it automatically. Just read
the README.TXT file that should come on the floppy with the drivers.

After that, reboot, and Windows will be able to work with it without problems.

Doing this in Windows ME is a little more complicated, because the MS-DOS is
hidden. To gain access to it, you have to install a little patch that you can
download from:

     http://www.geocities.com/mfd4life_2000

Once you have done this, you can install the MS-DOS CD-ROM driver as I
explained before.


19. After uninstalling GAG, my system doesn't boot because my primary
partitions are still hidden. What can I do to fix it?

In order to make your hidden partitions visible again, you need to use an
FDISK program that allows you to change this status. 
You can use FDISK from Linux (just booting from an install CD-ROM) or use
Ranish PART.exe or use a commercial program like PARTITION MAGIC.


20. After uninstalling GAG, I can't boot my computer. It shows me an 
error message. What does this mean?

The boot code that GAG puts in the MBR after uninstall, can return three
possible errors:

DISK ERROR: this means that the MBR code found a bad sector in your hard
disk and can't load it in order to boot. It means you have a damaged hard
disk, so be careful with your data.

NO BOOT SECTOR FOUND: this means that the active partition (the one that
should be booted at startup) has no operating system. To fix this, boot
with a floppy or a bootable CD and use FDISK (or its equivalent) to mark
another primary partition as the active partition.

NO ACTIVE PARTITION FOUND: this means that there is no partition marked 
as active in your hard disk. The way to fix this is the same than in the
previous case: just boot with a bootable floppy or CD and use FDISK (or
its equivalent) to mark any primary partition (with an OS installed, of
course) as the active partition.


21. Can I use a bootable CD-ROM instead a floppy to boot the installer?

Yes, you can. Just copy the file DISK.DSK somewhere onto the CD-ROM 
and tell your burn program to use that file as a 1.44Meg floppy image 
to boot from with the ELTORITO system.

This method is the best when you want to distribute GAG in a magazine or
similar, because people can boot the CD and find the installer, without
need to create a floppy.


22. How can I create more than one DOS primary partitions? The Windows'FDISK
doesn't allow me to do it.

The various Linux FDISK (fdisk, sfdisk, cfdisk ) can do that.
You can also use the FDISK from freedos. Just go to www.freedos.org, 
and you will find the boot disks and many more.


23. When I boot Windows from the second/third... hard disk, I receive a
virus alert. Why?

That's because GAG has to install a little resident program that intercepts
all the hard disk calls, in order to change them. This is similar to a
virus (with the difference, of course, that a virus is malign, but GAG
isn't), so antivirus programs think that there's a problem, because they
can't distingish between this resident and a malign virus.

The best solution is to not install windows in the second hard disk, and
install all of them in sepearate primary partitions on the first hard disk.


24. How can I put latin characters in the Russian version?

Lowercase letters are cyrillic characters, while uppercase letters are
latin characters.


25. I choosed a QWERTY keyboard and Russian language, and now I can't
configure GAG. Why?

You MUST use Russian language and Cyrillic keyboard together. You can't
use Cyrillic keyboard with other languages, or Russian language with other
keyboards.


26. What about Windows XP or Vista?

Everything I said about Windows 95/98/Me applies to XP/Vista, except the
detail about CD-ROM drives (they should work without problems).


27. I booted the GAG installer from a CD and I can't install it in a floppy

Booting from a CD works emulating a floppy; this means that A: is the CD
drive, and your physical floppy is now B:. GAG always try to install in A:;
it fails because the CD-ROM is read-only.


28. I forgot to install GRUB in the partition, and now I can't boot Linux

You have to boot from a Live-CD (like the Ubuntu install CD, or a Knoppix CD),
open a terminal and reinstall GRUB from there. It's easy to do, just run:

        sudo grub

It will display a new prompt. There type:

        root (hdX,Y)
        setup (hdX,Y)
        quit

being X the disk drive number where is located your Linux root partition
(0 being the first hard disk, 1 the second, and so on), and Y the partition
number (0 being the first primary partition, 1 the second primary partition,
2 the third primary partition and 3 the fourth primary partition. Numbers
4 and up are for extended partitions).

An example to understand this better: if your root partition is /dev/sda7,
then you must do:

        root (hd0,6)
        setup (hd0,6)
        quit

(0=first hard disk, 6=third extended partition).

Another example: your root partition is /dev/sdc2:

        root (hd2,1)
        setup (hd2,1)
        quit

Now your Linux partition should be bootable.

BE CAREFULL!!!! Hard disks are numbered as they are mounted AT BOOT TIME.
This means that if you have (example) one ATA disk (/dev/hda) and one
SATA disk (/dev/sda) and your boot sequence is ATA first and SATA after,
then the ATA disk will be disk 0, and SATA will be disk 1; but if the
boot sequence is SATA first and ATA after, then the SATA disk will be
disk 0 and ATA disk will be disk 1.


29. Can I boot GAG from an USB pendrive?

In theory it is possible, but only installing it from Linux AND if the pendrive
has a sector size of 512 bytes. Use gag-install using the pen device name. If
the program complains, try to re-create the partitions leaving some free
space at the begining.

I can't guarantee that this will work. The only pendrive I have access to
has a sector size of 2048 bytes, and my BIOS seems to dislike it.
