                  Installation instructions</h1>

      <p>GAG is a Boot Manager program, this is, a program that is loaded when
      the computer is turned on and allows to choose the operating system you
      want to use. Its main features are:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Allows you to boot up to 9 different operating systems.</li>
         <li>Can boot operating systems installed in primary and extended
             partitions. They can be installed on any hard disk too.</li>
         <li>GAG doesn't need its own partition. It installs itself in the
             first track of the hard disk, which is reserved for this kind
             of programs. It can also be installed on a floppy disk, without
             using the hard disk.</li>
         <li>Has a timer to boot a default operating system (selectable by
             the user).</li>
         <li>The configuration menu can be protected with a password. Also,
             each operating system can be protected with its own password.</li>
         <li>The program works in graphic modes (needs a VGA or better graphic
             card), and has a lot of icons.</li>
         <li>Hides the primary partitions, allowing the installation of more
             than one DOS and/or Windows OS on the same hard disk.</li>
         <li>Can exchange disk drives, allowing to boot from the second,
             third... hard disk operating systems such as MS-DOS.</li>
         <li>Has a SafeBoot system, which allows you to boot your hard disk
             even if GAG is accidentally overwritten.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

      <p>GAG is a program distributed 'as is', without any warranty of any
      kind. The author will not be responsible if there is loss of data on
      your hard disk or any other problem. Use it at your own risk.</p>

      <p>GAG is distributed under a GPL license. Here you can
      <a href="license.html">read it</a>.</p>

      <h2>BEFORE INSTALLING GAG</h2>

      <p>If you have an operating system which needs a boot loader (like
      Linux or BSD, which needs GRUB), you must install it in the
      SuperBlock of the root partition. With GRUB, just type from a
      command line (as root):</p>

      <p align="center">grub-install /dev/root_partition</p>

      <p>Being <b>root_partition</b> your root partition, of course.
      An example: if <b>/dev/sda7</b> is your root partition, just type:</p>

      <p align="center">grub-install /dev/sda7</p>

      <p>With windows there's no special care.</p>

      <h2>ABOUT THE LBA PARTITIONS SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>LBA support (for hard disks bigger than 8 Gigabytes) was added in
      the version 4.0. But it still relies on the BIOS, so you need a
      recent BIOS version that supports the INT13h extensions. These
      extensions were created in 1998, so if your BIOS was written before
      that year, GAG wont be able to boot operating systems located in a
      partition beyond the original limit of 8 Gigabytes.</p>

      <p>Of course, all current mainboards support them, so it should not be
      a problem unless you install GAG in a very old computer.</p>

      <h2>INSTALLATION PROCESS</h2>

      <p>There are two ways to install GAG: as a floppy disk image (both from
      a true floppy disk, or from a bootable CD-ROM), or directly from Linux.</p>

      <p>For the first method you will need a blank 3 1/2 inch, high density,
      formatted floppy, or a blank CD-ROM. This allows you to install GAG
      without worrying about what operating system you have (if you have
      only windows, you must use this method).</p>

      <h2>DIRECT INSTALLATION</h2>

      <p>This method is currently available only for Linux. Just open the
      <b>Linux</b> folder and run (as root) the script <b>copy-files.sh</b>.
      It will copy the linux installer and other needed files in /boot/gag.</p>

      <p>Now you can use <b>gag-install</b> to install gag in your hard disk,
      passing as parameter the device where you want to install it.</p>

      <p>Example: if <b>/dev/sda</b> is your boot hard disk, then you must use:</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo gag-install /dev/sda</p>

      <p>By default, this command install the english version and keyboard
      QWERTY. If you want to change it, you can specify the one you want
      with <b>-k</b> for the keyboard and <b>-l</b> for the language.
      An example:</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo gag-install -k azerty -l french /dev/sda</p>

      <p>To show the available keyboards, just type:</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo gag-install -k</p>

      <p>And to show the available languages, just type:</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo gag-install -l</p>

      <p>Again, don't forget to run <b>grub-install</b> before rebooting, or
      you won't be able to boot your Linux partition from GAG (if you already
      forgot it, just see in the FAQ how to fix it).</p>

      <p>Now you can continue with the next section:
      <a href="instruc2.html">Configuring GAG</a>.</p>

      <h2>INSTALLING FROM FLOPPY</h2>

      <p>First, you will need to create the floppy. That's done using the
      RAWRITE2.EXE program.</p>

      <p>Starting with GAG 4.01, all language versions are distributed on
      one single disk, with a little installation program. You only have to
      create the disk (see above the instructions of how to do it), boot
      your computer from that disk, et voila! The instructions for using it,
      the FAQ and the license can be read from the installer program.</p>

      <p>IMPORTANT: once created, the disk will be seem to be empty (this is,
      you will not be able to read it from MS-DOS, Windows,...) but GAG is on
      it. Just boot your computer from it.</p>

      <h3>FROM DOS</h3>

      <p>Insert the formatted disk in the floppy and type</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSTALL.BAT</p>

      <p>The program will create the boot floppy.</p>

      <h3>FROM WINDOWS 95/98/Me</h3>

      <p>Insert the formatted disk in your floppy drive.</p>

      <p>Open the folder where you unzipped the GAG's zip file and
      double-click the icon INSTALL.BAT</p>

      <h3>FROM WINDOWS NT/2000/XP/VISTA</h3>

      <p>Insert the formatted disk in your floppy drive.</p>

      <p>Open the folder where you unzipped the GAG's zip file and
      double-click the icon INSTALL_XP.CMD</p>

      <h3>FROM OS/2</h3>

      <p>Open a DOS session (it can be window or full screen) and do
      the same as in FROM DOS.</p>

      <p>If the program returns a DMA error, edit the CONFIG.SYS file
      and modify your DOS variable, putting it as</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOS=HIGH,UMB</p>

      <p>Default value is DOS=LOW,NOUMB.</p>

      <p>If you prefer, you can use the native program IMAGE.EXE,
      that comes in the OS/2 CD-ROM.</p>

      <h3>FROM LINUX/UNIX</h3>

      <p>Insert the formatted floppy in disk drive and type</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dd if=disk.dsk of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=2880</p>

      <p>If you prefer, you can do too:</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cat disk.dsk > /dev/fd0</p>

      <p>In other UNIX systems is possible you must use something different
      to /dev/fd0.</p>

      <h3>OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS</h3>

      <p>You need a program that allows you to create floppies from disk
      images, and use it to copy the file DISK.DSK into the floppy.</p>

      <h2>INSTALLING FROM CD-ROM</h2>

      <p>Just use your favourite CD burn program (like NERO) to burn the CD
      image <b>CDROM.ISO</b>. But remember: you have to go to the main menu
      and choose <b>Burn ISO image</b> (or simmilar). If you just burn the
      file in a data CD it won't work!</p>

      <h2>BOOTING GAG</h2>

      <p>Now that you have created the floppy or CD-ROM, restart your computer
      and boot it with the created floppy. You will see the main menu for the
      GAG Installer.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="install1.png"
                            alt="Initial instalation menu screen."></p>

      <p>Press '1' to read the instructions (are the same that you can find
      <a href="instruc2.html">here</a>), press '2' to read the FAQ (the same
      that you can read <a href="faq.html">here</a>), press '3' to read the
      license (again, you can read it <a href="copying.html">here</a>), or
      press '4' to start the installation. If you want to uninstall GAG,
      just boot with this floppy/CD-ROM and use the option '5'.</p>

      <p>After pressing '4', you will be prompted for your keyboard type:</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="install2.png"
                            alt="Keyboard selection screen."></p>

      <p>It's very common to name a keyboard with the six first letters in
      the upper row. So a QWERTY keyboard is the one that has the letters
      Q, W, E, R, T and Y in its upper row, just below the numbers. The
      QWERTY keyboard is the most common, but there are at least two variants:
      the QWERTZ, mainly used in germany, and the AZERTY, mainly used in france.</p>

      <p>The DVORAK keyboard is a special one, the position of each letter has
      been determined based on frequency of use, putting the most used letters
      directly under the fingers, and the less used in other positions. Some
      people affirm that this keyboard allows faster speeds (at least, that was
      the main goal when designed).</p>

      <p>Finally, the Cyrillic keyboard is used mainly in Russia and neighboring
      countries, and must be used together with the Russian language. You MUST
      NOT use Cyrillic keyboard with other languages, or other keyboards with
      the Russian language, because GAG will not work.</p>

      <p>With Cyrillic keyboard, lowercase strokes will become Cyrillic
      characters, and uppercase strokes will be converted to lowercase
      Latin characters.</p>

      <p>Finally, the installer will ask you what language do you want to use:</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="install3.png"
                            alt="Language selection screen."></p>

      <p>After choosing the one you want, the installer will load GAG itself:</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="install4.png"
                            alt="Initial OS selection screen."></p>

      <p>At this point you can continue with the next section:
      <a href="instruc2.html">Configuring GAG</a>.</p>

      <h2>ERRORS RETURNED BY GAG'S INSTALLER WHEN IT BOOTS</h2>

      <p>When GAG's installer boots, it makes some tests. If it finds an error,
      it shows a number in the screen and halts the system. The errors are these
      ones:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>GAG: 1
            <p>BAD SECTOR: there was a read error while trying to load GAG.
            If you was booting from floppy, use another floppy without bad
            sectors. If you was booting from hard disk, use SafeBoot to boot
            an operating system and reinstall GAG. If the error persists,
            you have bad sectors in your hard disk.</p></li>
         <li>GAG: 3
           <p>GAG INSTALLER NOT FOUND: the code loaded from the floppy or the
           hard disk does not have the GAG signature. It's possible that the
           first track has been overwritten. Create again the floppy disk
           (or CD) and try again.</p></li>
      </ul>
