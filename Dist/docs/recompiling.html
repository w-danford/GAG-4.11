      <h1 align="center">GAG<br>the Graphical Boot Manager<br>
      Recompiling GAG from source code</h1>

      <p>All utilities that a user could need to recompile GAG from source
      code (except for Borland's TurboAssembler) is available in the folder
      <b>devel</b>, and all the source code is available in the folder
      <b>devel/src</b></p>


      <p>In the <b>devel/src</b> folder are the following files:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>gag.asm</b>: contains GAG's source code (except the messages
                   and font, which are language-dependant).</li>
        <li><b>install.asm</b>: contains the installer's source code.</li>
        <li><b>boot.asm</b>: is the source code for the installer's boot sector.</li>
        <li><b>messages.txt</b>: messages for the installer.</li>
        <li><b>copying</b>: license (for adding to the installer).</li>
        <li><b>faq.txt</b>: FAQ (for adding to the installer).</li>
        <li><b>readme.txt</b>: instructions file (for adding to the installer).</li>
        <li><b>put_returns.py</b>: the messages, license, FAQ and instructions
              must use CR/LF returns to ensure that the installer will process
              them right. This little python script process them to ensure that.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In that folder there are a lot of folders with language names. Each
      one contains one file <b>messages.msg</b> and another one <b>font.fnt</b>.
      These files are language specific, and must be in the same folder as
      <b>gag.asm</b> to be able to create a working executable.</p>

      <p>In <b>devel</b> there is <b>mklang.bat</b>, a DOS batch file that
      compiles any GAG language versions. It takes as an argument the name
      of any langauge folder putting the compiled executable named as
      'language'.com in the current folder, where 'language' is the name of
      the language/folder. Then it deletes all the temporary files. Another
      DOS batch file, <b>mkmain.bat</b> compiles the boot code, packager and
      the installer, putting all compiled executables in the current folder.
      Then it deletes all the temporary files.</p>

      <p>To compile the assembler files you need Borland's TurboAssembler,
      running it in a DOS box, or a compatible assembler (it must be able
      to create DOS .COM executables, in 16-bit real mode, and accept the
      TurboAssembler syntax). To use any other DOS 16 bit real mode assembler
      you will need to correct the syntax to match the assembler (NASM, MASM,
      etc.)</p>

      <p>The program <b>mezcla.c</b>, when compiled, takes all these executables
      and the files <b>messages.txt</b>, <b>copying</b>, <b>readme.txt</b> and
      <b>faq.txt</b> and mixes them in a single, 1.44MB file, called <b>disk.dsk</b>,
      which is ready to be used as a floppy disk image. The batch file
      <b>mkmain.bat</b> compiles mezcla.c using Borland's BCC55 C compiler.</p>

      <p>In <b>makecd.txt</b> is the cdrecord command line that you need to create,
      from the GAG folder, a bootable CD with GAG.</p>
