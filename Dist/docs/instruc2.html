                                     Using and configuring it</h1>

      <h2>USING GAG</h2>

      <p>When GAG starts for first time, it will show the main menu.
      There are only two icons: boot from floppy and Setup.
      Below each description is the key you have to press to select
      that action.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="install4.png"
                            alt="Initial OS list screen."></p>

      <p>If you press S (Setup, but the key can be different if you
      choose a language different than English), GAG will show the
      Setup Menu, with these options:</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="config1.png"
                            alt="Configuration menu screen."></p>

      <p>You can choose an option just pressing the colored key.</p>

      <h3>ADD A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM</h3>

      <p>The first option allows to add to GAG's menu an operating system
      installed on one of your hard disks. When you choose it, GAG shows
      a list with all the partitions in your first hard disk. The primary
      partitions are showed in black, and the extended partitions in blue.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="config2.png"
                            alt="Drive partition list screen."></p>

      <p>In the upper example we see that the first hard disk contains two
      primary partitions, which type is 83 in hexadecimal (Linux EXT2/EXT3),
      and two extended partitions, one with type 82h (Linux Swap) and another
      one with type 83h again.</p>

      <p>But these are only the first hard disk's partitions. To see the
      partitions in the second hard disk you must press the key '2'. To see
      the partitions in the third hard disk, just press the key '3', and so on.</p>

      <p>Now you have to choose the partition that contains the operating system
      that you want to add, just by pressing the corresponding letter.</p>

      <p>If you choose a partition from the second, third... hard disk, GAG
      will ask you if you want to swap the disk drives. But if the partition
      is in the first hard disk, you will not see this question.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="config3.png"
                            alt="Drive letter exchange pop up."></p>

      <p>If you answer YES, each time you boot with that icon a small resident
      program will be installed, which will swap that drive and the first hard
      disk, so the operating system will think that the second (or third...)
      hard disk is the first (C:) and the first is the second (or third...)
      (D:). This allows you to boot operating systems such as MS-DOS from the
      second, third... disk, and not only from the first.</p>

      <p><b>WARNING</b>: this resident driver will use up 1 KByte of conventional
      memory. The resident program works at BIOS level, so it will not work with
      operating systems that use specific drivers to access the hard disk.
      Anyway, it can be needed to boot operating systems like Windows XP/Vista
      when they are installed in the second, third... hard disks.</p>

      <p>The resident program is installed even if you choose the option
      <b>Boot from floppy</b> from a hard disk different than the first.
      This allows you to create an icon that boots from floppy with the hard
      disks swapped, allowing you to install that operating systems in theses
      drives directly, without unmounting or physically disconecting them.</p>

      <p>Now you should type a short description (up to 15 characters)
      for the Operating system. As an example: Linux, OS/2, Windows...</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="config4.png"
                            alt="OS description entry pop up."></p>

      <p>Then, you can add a password to protect the operating system.
      This password must be typed each time you want to boot this operating
      system. If you just press here RETURN, no password will be required.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="config5.png"
                            alt="Password entry pop up."></p>

      <p>Finally, you choose the icon you want for that O.S. just by pressing
      a letter from A to Z (A for the first icon, B for the second...)</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="config6.png"
                            alt="Icon selection screen."></p>

      <p>Repeat this for each Operating System you have on your hard disk.</p>


      <h3>DELETE AN OPERATING SYSTEM</h3>

      <p>This option deletes the entry of an operating system from GAG.
      When you press D, GAG will show you the configured operating systems.
      Press a number from 1 to 9 to delete it from the boot menu.
      But <b>WARNING</b>: this option <b>DOES NOT DELETE the operating system
      from the hard disk</b>; it only deletes it from the GAG list, you can
      add it again. To delete an O.S. you have to use FDISK, some other
      partition manager, or just format or wipe the partition or drive where
      installed.</p>

      <p>If you don't want to delete an O.S. (you pressed the wrong key),
      you can press ESC to return.</p>


      <h3>BOOT TIMER</h3>

      <p>This option allows us to select the time in seconds that GAG must wait
      before booting the default O.S. The maximum is 99 seconds. If we have
      the timer enabled and want to disable it, just press RETURN or type 0.</p>

      <p>The boot timer will be disabled if you delete the default O.S.</p>

      <p>After typing the number of seconds, GAG will show you the list of
      installed operating systems. You have to select the one you want to boot
      after the timer expires.</p>


      <h3>SETUP PASSWORD</h3>

      <p>With this option GAG will require a password to enter in the Setup menu.
      This is usefull when GAG is instaled in a 'public' computer.</p>


      <h3>HIDE PRIMARY PARTITIONS</h3>

      <p>When this option is active (marked with a '1' or '2', see the red
      circle in the next picture), GAG 4.11 will hide all primary partitions
      '2' on the boot drive except the one that is booting, or '1' only those
      before the partition that is booting. This avoids DOS/Windows system
      from interfering with another DOS/Windows installed in the same disk.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="config7.png" alt=""></p>

      <p>When this option is inactive, GAG 4.11 will hide no primary partitions,
      In testing with WIN NT 4.0 sp6 on the first primary partition, MSDOS 6.22
      on the second primary partition, and Win98 SE on the third primary partition
      all OS booted with no problems withotu hiding any paretitions. The system
      this was tested on has Athlon 900 Mhz single core processor. This behavior
      is new in GAG 4.11.</p>

      <p>Another feature inprovement in GAG 4.11 is all partitions are unhidden
      on all physical drives other than the one being booted to. This guarantees
      that if last boot up hd0 for example was booted, then this time hd1, or hd2,
      ... is being booted any partitions that were hidden on hd0 last boot up are
      now unhidden.</p>

      <p>Let's see it with an example: imagine that we have five partitions:
      three primary ones (1 to 3) and two extended (4 and 5). If this option is
      active '2' and you boot the Operating system installed in partition 2, GAG
      4.11 will hide partitions 1 and 3 (partitions 4 and 5, being extended, will
      be always visible). But if this option is '1' and you boot from partition 2,
      GAG 4.11 will hide only partition 1, and partition 3 will remain visible.
      Or if this option is inactive GAG 4.11 hides no partitions and both
      partitions 1 and 3 will remain visible.</p>

      <h3>RETURN TO MAIN MENU</h3>

      <p>With this option you return to the main menu (to select an OS to boot).</p>


      <h3>SAVE IN FLOPPY</h3>

      <p>With this option GAG and the actual configuration is saved on a floppy.
      This allows testing GAG without installing it on the hard disk.</p>

      <p>Remember that you must use this option (or the next one) each time you
      change your configuration (when you add or delete an operating system, or
      when you change the timer or the password) to store the changes.</p>

      <h3>SAVE IN HARD DISK</h3>

      <p>This option allow us to save GAG and the actual configuration in your
      hard disk's MBR, so it will be loaded every time we turn on the computer.
      Since GAG is bigger than 512 bytes, only a small loader is saved in the
      MBR, and GAG itself is stored in the first 62 sectors of the first track,
      which are reserved for this kind of programs. But this has some small
      problems:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>GAG cannot be installed on a hard disk with less than 42 sectors
         per track. If you try to do it, GAG will return an error message.
         This isn't really a big problem, because today all hard disk have
         63 sectors per track. Only very old hard disks (made before the
         year 1992) can have problems with this.
         In that case, GAG will return an error ('Disk error') and will
         not be installed.<p></li>

         <li>Some old BIOSes (before 1992, aprox) can't recognize hard disks
         with more than 1024 cylinders. In these cases, there are a lot of
         programs that fix this. The problem is that these programs
         store themselves in the first track, so GAG is incompatible
         with them.<p></li>

         <li>Some viruses install itself in the first track too, so if a day,
         instead of GAG, an O.S. is booted directly, it is possible that
         there's one in your hard disk.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I strongly recommend to test GAG first from a floppy, and only if it
      works correctly, install it on the Hard Disk.</p>

      <p><b>WARNING</b>: each time you change the options or the list of O.S.
      to boot, or the timer or configuration password, you must use the
      <b>SAVE IN FLOPPY</b> or <b>SAVE IN HARD DISK</b> options to store
      the changes; otherwise they will not be saved.</p>

      <h3>WHAT IS SAFEBOOT?</h3>

      <p>SafeBoot is a GAG's feature that allows to boot your hard disk always.
      If there is an error when GAG is loading, just reset your computer and
      hold down the SHIFT, ALT or CNTRL key. Instead of loading GAG, the MBR
      code will load the last operating system used, so you can reinstall GAG
      or fix the error.</p>

      <p>To avoid a 'security hole', SafeBoot is disabled if there is an entry
      with password. This is because SafeBoot doesn't use passwords, so a
      malicious person can use it to jump over them. But if you have password
      only for the Setup option, but not for booting the operating systems,
      SafeBoot will be available.</p>

      <p>Remember that you can have a floppy disk with GAG installed and
      configured for your hard disk, so you can use it as a rescue disk if
      some problem occurs.</p>

      <h3>ERRORS RETURNED BY GAG WHEN IT BOOTS</h3>

      <p>When GAG boots, it makes some tests. If it finds an error, it shows an
      error-number on the screen and halts the system. The errors are theses:</p>

      <h4>GAG: 1</h4>

      <p>BAD SECTOR: there was a read error when trying to load GAG. If you were
      booting from floppy, reinstall it on another floppy without bad sectors.
      If you were booting from hard disk, use SafeBoot to boot an operating
      system and reinstall GAG. If the error is still present, you have bad
      sectors on your hard disk.</p>

      <h4>GAG: 2</h4>

      <p>ACTIVE PARTITION NOT FOUND: this error occurs only with SafeBoot.
      There is no one partition marked as active (this is, marked as C:).
      Just boot with a floppy, use FDISK, or any other partition manager,
      to mark one and reset.</p>

      <h4>GAG: 3</h4>

      <p>GAG NOT FOUND: the code loaded from the floppy or the hard disk
      dose not have the GAG signature. It is possible that the first track
      has been overwriten. Use SafeBoot and reinstall GAG.</p>

      <h4>GAG: 4</h4>

      <p>NO BOOT SECTOR: this error can occurr only with SafeBoot.
      The active partition does not contain a valid operating system.
      Reboot with a floppy, use FDISK to mark another partition as active
      and reboot.</p>


      <h3>GAG AND THE OPERATING SYSTEMS</h3>

      <p>If you want to use GAG with MS-DOS or Windows 95/98, you don't need
      to do anything special, because they can be installed only in primary
      partitions.</p>

      <p>If you want to use GAG with OS/2, it is possible that, during the O.S.
      installation, you must install the OS/2 Boot Manager too (this ocurrs
      when you install OS/2 in an extended partition and/or in the second,
      third... hard disk). Don't worry. Continue the instalation and, after
      it ends, install GAG. But there is a little problem: when OS/2 is
      installed in an extended partition, GAG can't boot it directly. You
      must install the OS/2 Boot Manager, and boot it from GAG. To prevent
      the Boot Manager's menu from being displayed, you can set its timer
      to zero seconds. But if you want to boot OS/2 from a primary partition
      of the second, or third... hard disk, you only have to answer YES to the
      'Exchange drive letters' option, you don't need to use the IBM Boot
      Manager.</p>

      <p>If you want to use GAG with Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista, you have to
      install its Boot Manager, NTLDR, in the same partition as the O.S.,
      but you can put its timer to 0 seconds.</p>

      <p>If you want to use GAG with Linux, you only need to install LILO
      or GRUB in the Boot Sector of the partition where the kernel is.</p>

      <p>If you have different Linux-kernels in different partitions, you will
      have to put a different LILO or GRUB on each partition, possibly setting
      the LILO/GRUB timer to 0.</p>

      <p>Of course, GAG can be used with all other operating systems too,
      such AIX, FreeBSD, BeOS...</p>

      <p>When the timer is active, a decrementing orange bar is shown at the
      top of the screen. If you press a key, the timer is stopped. If you
      press RETURN, the default operating system is booted.</p>

      <p><b>WARNING</b>: if the BIOS virus protection is enabled, you can get
      false alarms each time you boot a new O.S. This is because to hide
      partitions, GAG (and all Boot Managers) must change a bit in the
      partition entry, in the MBR, thus rewrite the MBR</p>
